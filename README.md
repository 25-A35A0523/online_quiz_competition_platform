# QuizNova – Online Quiz Competition Platform

## 1. Project Title
**QuizNova – Online Quiz Competition Platform**

Traditional learning and self-assessment tools are static and fail to engage students meaningfully.

- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Smart quiz suggestions based on individual performance.
- **Results Page:** Instant feedback with score summary after every quiz attempt.
